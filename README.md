### Thanks for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Akasha, a data scientist currently working at [Novo Nordisk](https://www.novonordisk.com/) in Boston, Massachusetts. My current work focuses on the Digital Health space, but this (personal) profile focuses on anything that inspires me to code in my free time ðŸ˜„ 

In case you are looking for an easy-to-read format, most of my git code ends up on my personal [website](http://www.akashastrub.com/).
